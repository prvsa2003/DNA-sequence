# DNA-sequence
This program displays the number of repetitions of each state by taking a sequenced string of DNA and getting the number of sequences expected by the user.
For example, you can give a DNA strand and set the sequence number to 3, it will display the number of repeats of each of the triplet sequences (total of 64 states) along with the total.
